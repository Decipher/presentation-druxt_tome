This is the Umami Parity project, it's my testing ground and goal posts for the Druxt 1.0 release.

The Backend is a standard Drupal Umami profile install, with the Druxt module and some minor customisations.

The Frontend is an instance of the DruxtSite module using the BootstrapVue UI framework and custom DruxtWrapper theme components.

Let's take a quick walk through of the site __ BRIAN:
(BRIAN TO SHARE)
- It's serving Full Statically generated HTML, which Nuxt hydrates to provide client-side navigation.
- This also allows for Layout components, which provide modern User experience, like the SearchBar.
- The Frontend is hosted on Amazee's Lagoon, however, being Full static allows it to run on services like Netlify and Vercel.

The source code is all available on github, so be sure to check it out.
