<div class="my-10 grid grid-cols-[30px,100px] w-min gap-y-4 mx-auto">

<!--
Druxt extends Nuxt, and in the case of the DruxtSite module we can see that by the presence of the DruxtRouter wildcard route.

Nuxt has a Page based routing system, which allows frontend driven campaign pages and single page apps, among other things, but in our case we want Drupal to serve the homepage, so I'll go ahead and delete this page.

1. Show Page
2. Open VueDevTools > Routes
3. Delete `pages/index.vue`
4. Reveal no content.
5. Walkthrough components
6. Recap
